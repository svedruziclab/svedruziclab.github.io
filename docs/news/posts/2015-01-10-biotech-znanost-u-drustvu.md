Discussing [the study programs at the Department of Biotechnology](https://www.biotech.uniri.hr/en/study-programmes.html), Dr. Svedružić was optimistic about their future in spite of the present challenges:

> Two years ago, economic experts in the German government pointed out that the development of biotechnology was the future of German industry. Finally, the pharmaceutical and related biochemical industries are today among the few industries in Croatia that are positively operating and competitive in the international market, despite a lagging administrative and political environment. Therefore, the facts show that studying biotechnology has a future if the opportunities are exploited.
