## Note to taxpayers

Much of the work of the BioSFGroup is paid with Croatian tax dollars, administered as research grants through the [University of Rijeka](https://uniri.hr/) and the [Croatian Science Foundation](https://hrzz.hr/). We are truly grateful for this support and are committed to making sure the public gets the best possible return on their investments in terms of scientific knowledge generated, new insights into disease mechanisms and treatments, new technologies developed and made freely available, training of the next generation of scientists, transactions with companies from whom we purchase research supplies and equipment, and gainful employment of project staff.
